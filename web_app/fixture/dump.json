However, LUNAтАЩs market shows no such signs, with derivatives data signaling investor caution.</p><p>тАЬPeople appear to be shorting LUNA perpetual futures, as evidenced from rising open interest and persistent negative funding,тАЭ a person associated with Swiss-based crypto derivatives tracking platform Laevitas told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat.</p><p>Open interest represented by the amount of dollars locked in the perpetual futures contracts has doubled to $394 million since Dec. 15. Indeed, the metric does not tell us whether the market is skewed bearish or bullish. But when combined with the funding rates, it provides insights on what traders have been doing.</p><p>In LUNAтАЩs case, funding rates have consistently stayed negative since Dec. 15, a sign that short position traders have been dominant and paying long traders.</p><p>Perpetuals are futures without expiry. Exchanges use the funding rate mechanism to ensure perpetuals are priced around the underlying assetтАЩs market price. As discussed in the explainer, the funding rate is paid every eight hours.</p><p>According to Delphi Digital, negative funding rates across major exchanges signal the presence of delta-neutral traders тАУ people who take multiple positions to neutralize delta exposure or directional bias.</p><p>тАЬThe price increase over the last few days was likely triggered by investors buying spot LUNA to lock up in the Astroport lockdrop, then hedging their position via perpetual futures to remain delta neutral,тАЭ analytics firm Delphi Digital said in a research note published Monday.</p><p>Astroport, a new decentralized exchange, went live on Dec. 14 with a lockdrop facility airdropping ASTRO tokens to users who lock up their liquidity in the protocol.</p><p>The lure of making free money via lockdrop seems to have drawn investors to Astroport, taking out LUNA supply from the market. According to data source DeFi Llama, the DEX has pulled in more than $1 billion into the Terra ecosystem. More than 50% of that figure consists of LUNA tokens.</p><p>In October, Terra announced the implementation of proposal 44 to burn 90 million tokens held in the community pool, taking a page out of EthereumтАЩs EIP-1559 upgrade that introduced the supposedly-deflationary ETH burn mechanism.</p><p>See also: Terra Becomes Second-Largest DeFi Protocol, Surpassing Binance Smart Chain</p>",

Polygon is currently the No. 7 chain by TVL, per Defi Llama data.</p><p>A report by blockchain data firm Chainalysis earlier this year said DeFi is still dominated by experienced crypto traders and investors, partly due to the costly transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain.

Terra, which is behind Ethereum, crossed Binance Smart Chain (BSC) this week.</p><p>On Terra, 13 projects lock over $18.2 billion in value, data from analytics tool DeFi Llama shows. ThatтАЩs over $1.4 billion per protocol on average compared with an average of $73 million per protocol on BSC, which has $16.5 billion locked on 225 protocols.</p><p>The figures are a nearly 42,000% increase compared to December 2020, when DeFi projects on Terra held $42 million in value.</p><p>Ethereum retains the DeFi crown with $152 billion in value locked on 361 protocols. DeFi projects rely on smart contracts instead of middlemen for financial services such as lending, trading and borrowing.</p><p>Leading the TVL charts on Terra is Anchor, a savings protocol offering low-volatile yields on Terra stablecoin deposits. Anchor locks over $7.7 billion in value and accounts for 42% of TerraтАЩs TVL. Anchor users accrue rewards through a diversified stream of staked rewards from major proof-of-stake blockchains.</p><p>Staked assets liquidity provider Lido is next on the list with over $5.4 billion in TVL. In third place is decentralized exchange (DEX) Terraswap, which has seen its TVL increase over 95% in the past week. Terraswap matches peer-to-peer trades between users using TerraтАЩs smart contracts. All liquidity, as on other DEXs, is contributed by the users themselves, in return for token rewards based on the amount of liquidity they provide for each trading pair.</p><p>Metaverse and gaming applications have made their mark on Terra as well. The recently launched StarTerra, which calls itself a gamified launchpad that supports nobn-fungible token (NFT) integration, locks up $21 million in value, while LoTerra, a decentralized lottery, holds over $311,000 in value.</p><p>The increase in TVL on Terra coincided with the rising price of its LUNA token. The price is up 54% compared to the past week, trading at all-time highs of $83 on Tuesday morning, as per data from CoinGecko.</p><p>Some attribute LUNAтАЩs success to both its token mechanisms and use in DeFi applications. тАЬTerra has recently been very successful both in terms of its LUNA coin price and the TVL on its DeFi protocols. The demand for the LUNA token mostly stems from the demand for UST, the algorithmic stablecoin on Terra which is minted using (burning) LUNA,тАЭ said Adrian Krion, CEO of Web 3 gaming company Spielworks.</p><p>тАЬUnlike other layer 1 blockchains, TerraтАЩs TVL isnтАЩt mainly driven by swap protocols but by savings protocols utilizing so-called bonded tokens, native LUNA tokens which participate in the stabilization of the protocol and thereby generate yield,тАЭ he said in a message to CoinDesk.</p><p>LUNA was one of the strongest-performing cryptocurrencies in the past month even as the broader market tumbled. Bitcoin and ether have traded in a tight range since November 2021, but tokens of Ethereum rivals Solana and Avalanche have seen gains as traders placed bets on them outperforming Ethereum.</p><p>Some in crypto circles refer to investing in SOL, LUNA and AVAX as the SoLunAvax trio, and the trade has netted nearly 400% since May 2021 compared to an equally weighted basket of bitcoin and ether in the same time period.</p><p>UPDATE (Dec. 21, 08:57 UTC): Adds Spielworks CEOтАЩs comment in ninth and tenth paragraph.</p>",

Such exchanges are a subset of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, which relies on smart contracts instead of middlemen for financial services such as lending, trading, and borrowing.</p><p>The ease of staking and harvesting increased yields on Grim Finance attracted over $100 million in user funds to the protocol, according to total value locked (TVL) metrics on analytics tool DeFi Llama. They remained safe until yesterday.</p><p>Attackers used a тАЬreentrancyтАЭ exploit to steal funds from Grim Finance. Such an exploit is common on Solidity, the code behind the Ethereum and Fantom blockchains. It sees attackers manipulate data by interacting with the network and calling an untrusted contract, allowing them to gain control of the assets stored on whichever contact they exploited. This time, it was Grim FinanceтАЩs yield-compounding vaults.</p><p>The attackers took nearly $30 million in fantom tokens, data from Fantom blockchain explorers show. Much of that seems to have already been routed to other Fantom-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as AnySwap and SpookySwap, where the stolen tokens were exchanged for other tokens, such as USD coin, a dollar-pegged stablecoin, in one such instance.</p><p>Developers paused all vaults on Sunday to prevent further damages. They further informed USDC issuer Circle, AnySwap and Maker to freeze any assets related to the exploit.</p><p>The hack caused an exodus of total value locked on Grim Finance. Just $4.3 million remains in Grim Finance vaults, and TVL fell 84% in the past 24 hours.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Justin Sun isnтАЩt accustomed to being overlooked nor is he happy when he feels that one of his projects isnтАЩt getting enough attention. Sun, who is known for his self-promotion and marketing stunts at least as much for the Tron blockchain network he founded, is rankled because the recent explosive growth on Tron is being overshadowed by better known rival Polygon. So Sun is using his substantial aggrandizement skills to fix that perception.</p><p>While statements from one of the most visible and vocal figures in crypto often can suffer from hyperbole, data shows that a few little-known decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on the Tron network have surpassed their better-known counterparts, such as Ethereum-based SushiSwap and PolygonтАЩs QuickSwap by certain metrics.</p><p>The achievements did not come overnight, according to Sun, who told CoinDesk that growth on the Tron blockchain has been quite тАЬlow-keyтАЭ compared with others, namely protocol Polygon, a \"layer 2\" product that is built on top of the Ethereum platform.</p><p>тАЬWe have always been bigger than Polygon, but many in the markets have underestimated us,тАЭ Sun said, without specifying the metrics that make Tron тАЬbiggerтАЭ than Polygon. тАЬAfter all, Polygon has been a bit more high profile, and we are relatively low-key.тАЭ</p><p>тАЬBeing low-key doesnтАЩt mean we have not been doing well,тАЭ Sun added.</p><p>If Tron is bigger in some way than Polygon, itтАЩs not in тАЬtotal value locked.тАЭ According to data from DeFi Llama, the total value locked in Polygon stands at around $7.73 billion. While the total value locked on Tron is estimated at around $6 billion at the time of publication. (Total value locked refers to the amount secured on a DeFi app.)</p><p>A tweet by Sun in March shows that the total value locked on Tron surpassed $8 billion at the time, while growth in Polygon appears to only have started taking off in May and June when its total value locked went as high as above $11 billion from a little more than $1 billion at the end of April.</p><p>But Tron is growing faster in other areas. A report by blockchain data analysis site DappRadar titled тАЬJustSwap on Tron Attracts More Users Than QuickSwapтАЭ says that in the 30-day period ended on July 19, decentralized exchange (DEX) JustSwap тАУ TronтАЩs version of Uniswap on Ethereum тАУ gained about 200,000 unique users, an increase of more than 200% compared with a 1% increase in the same time period on QuickSwap, the most popular DEX on Polygon.</p><p>Also in the same 30-day period, JustSwap surpassed QuickSwap and EthereumтАЩs SushiSwap and was behind only Uniswap тАУ the тАЬunbeatable leaderтАЭ for DEXes тАУ by unique active wallets, according to DappRadar.</p><p>Polygon and the DeFi protocols built on the layer 2 product have become more popular in recent months, as traders and Ethereum-based DeFi projects flock to the protocol for cheaper transaction costs and faster block time.</p><p>Also known for cheaper and faster transactions than Ethereum, Tron also has gained traction lately with impressive growth in stablecoin: There are more USDT, the most popular stablecoin, on Tron than on Ethereum already and USD coin (USDC), another popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, that also recently started supporting Tron.</p><p>But the sudden growth of the DEXes on Tron still got some analysts and market participants scratching their heads because the DeFi sector, in general, has cooled down in the recent months, with Ryan Watkins, an analyst at Messari, saying тАЬThatтАЩs odd.тАЭ The monthly volume on Ethereum-based DEXes to date in July is well below $50 billion, less than one-third of MayтАЩs volume.</p><p>Sun attributed the importance of stablecoin and AsiaтАЩs market in DeFi for fast-paced DeFi growth on Tron.</p><p>тАЬThe stablecoin ecosystem is the most essential part of all trading in decentralized exchanges,тАЭ Sun said. тАЬWithout a stablecoin ecosystem, you canтАЩt trade...this is one of our biggest advantages.тАЭ</p><p>Stablecoins are digital tokens whose values are pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. They are used by traders and others as an intermediary step before putting money in riskier cryptocurrencies. While USDT still dominates the stablecoin market, USDC is among the most popular stablecoins in DeFi. With USDC now also supporting Tron blockchain, it is likely that USDC on Tron can boost the development of DeFi on the blockchain.</p><p>According to Circle, the crypto financial services firm that powers USDC, one of the goals of partnering with Tron is тАЬenabling [USDC] growth in Asia and around the globe.тАЭ</p><p>As a businessman born and raised in China, Sun and his success can be largely attributed to the market in the greater China region: Even today as the crypto crackdown is getting tougher in China, his Weibo account (the equivalent of Twitter in China) remains active as he leads discussions about Tron тАУ whether about DeFi or non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p><p>тАЬTron has always established a substantial market share in Asia,тАЭ Sun said. тАЬMany [crypto] users in Korea, Japan and mainland China are used to protocols on Tron. ItтАЩs a known fact that in Asia, the crypto market has been performing quite well.тАЭ</p><p>DappRadarтАЩs report concluded that if DeFi on Tron can continue growing at its current pace, Tron could soon become a тАЬsteadyтАЭ competitor for Polygon, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and even Ethereum.</p><p>But Sun told CoinDesk that he does not view Tron as a potential competitor to blockchains like Binance Smart Chain or Ethereum.</p><p>тАЬThis is not about whoтАЩs taking whose slice of the cake,тАЭ he said, using a metaphor about the distribution of the crypto market thatтАЩs often used by Chinese. тАЬThis is about making this cake bigger altogether...BSC and we are experiencing explosive growth...We can both meet the needs that cannot be satisfied on Ethereum.тАЭ</p>",

Retail traders piled in, even as some institutional investors sounded warnings about rampant speculation. (By Damanick Dantes)</p><p>Hello, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021, weтАЩre using this space to recap this yearтАЩs most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets тАУ and highlight the key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, weтАЩll recap what shook crypto markets this year. (For the latest crypto prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)</p><p>In our first episode today, we show how, even as bitcoinтАЩs price soared in the early days of the year, some savvy institutional investors were already growing cautious on cryptocurrencies after a wave of buying during the fourth quarter of 2020.</p><p>Bitcoin (BTC) started 2021 on a strong note, gaining nearly 40% during the first week of January and surging to a new all-time high around $40,000.</p><p>But not everyone was convinced the rally could be sustained.</p><p>Retail traders piled in, while some institutional investors started to raise concerns about rampant speculation.</p><p>As early as December, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto asset management firm Arca, had told CoinDesk that тАЬthere is a good chance that actively managed hedge funds and passive indexes built around high allocations to bitcoin have a very short shelf life.тАЭ</p><p>Indeed, a few funds established bitcoin positions but did not тАЬhold on for dear lifeтАЭ тАУ a commonly misconstrued back-formation of the crypto-jargon term тАЬHODL,тАЭ which originally appeared as a fast-typing (or maybe drunk?) personтАЩs attempt to type the world тАЬhold.тАЭ</p><p>Bitcoin quickly advanced from $30,000 to $40,000 within the first five trading days of January тАУ an impressive gain that fueled even more market excitement. The sharp price rise in BTC contributed to a $1.1 billion profit for Ruffer Investments, a U.K. based investment management firm, in just five months. By June, Ruffer stated that a тАЬspeculative frenzyтАЭ in cryptocurrencies forced the firm to exit its bets on further gains.</p><p>And Ruffer was not alone in its concern about market exuberance. Volatile price swings caused other institutional investors to doubt a prolonged crypto rally.</p><p>Sure enough, by the end of January, bitcoin had declined about 30% from a January high of near $40,000. Shortly after the price drop, Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at the Guggenheim global investment firm, said he didnтАЩt believe bitcoinтАЩs investor base was тАЬbig enoughтАЭ or тАЬdeep enoughтАЭ to keep prices at current levels.</p><p>тАЬRight now, the reality of the institutional demand that would support a $35,000 price or even a $30,000 price is just not there,тАЭ he said.</p><p>At the same time, a JPMorgan analyst said a bearish outlook could be triggered if bitcoin failed to claw its way back over $40,000, leading to steeper losses over the ensuing weeks.</p><p>Demand from institutional investors was said to have been the cause for the astronomical rise of the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization in the fourth quarter of 2020, when Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller and MicroStrategy said they had jumped into the market.</p><p>As coming installments of this series will show, the rest of 2021 would be defined by market-moving tweets from electric-vehicle billionaire Elon Musk, rapid price rallies in barely-heard-of alternative cryptocurrencies, a fresh wave of corporate buy-in to the legitimacy and potential of digital assets, plenty more moments of extreme volatility тАУ and, eventually, a new all-time high of around $69,000.</p><p>3 p.m. HKT/SGT (7 a.m. UTC): U.K. gross domestic product (Nov.

Shiba inu even broke into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in October 2021, surpassing even dogecoin for a few hours at the time.</p><p>Developers of the Shiba Inu protocol have attempted to move away from the predominantly meme coin narrative in 2020 to introduce new technical services in 2021, which has helped fuel community adoption and prices.</p><p>Early 2021 saw the launch of decentralized exchange ShibaSwap, bringing with it decentralized finance (DeFi) services such as staking and lending. DeFi refers to a financial system reliant on smart contracts instead of centralized middlemen that offers services like lending, trading and borrowing to users.</p><p>Then, in December 2021, the projectтАЩs pseudonymous founder Ryoshi said development for a Shiba Inu-centric metaverse called Oshiverse was in play, following the recent trend of metaverse projects and application in the broader crypto market. Oshiverse would be based on Shibarium, a layer 2 system built atop Ethereum for Shiba Inu, they added.</p>",

The accelerator is alleging that Armstrong, Coinbase and related entities committed fraud, interfered with a contract and were unjustly enriched among other charges.</p><p>The company is seeking damages and other forms of relief as part of a jury trial.</p><p>MouseBelt also alleged that Armstrong contacted Knowledgr founder Patrick Joyce in late June 2019 offering to personally invest $50,000 for a 1% share with a view to Coinbase making a larger investment subject to due diligence. The $50,000 was wired to Knowledgr in mid-July.</p><p>It was, according to the complaint, ArmstrongтАЩs intent to тАЬsteal MouseBeltтАЩs work for themselves, to not only eliminate a potential competitor but to obtain for ResearchHub the benefits of the financial, design and technical resources MouseBelt put into Knowledgr, thereby allowing ResearchHub to launch sooner at less cost a successful platform based entirely or substantially on MouseBeltтАЩs work.тАЭ</p><p>According to the complaint, Armstrong promised Joyce a job if he contributed to ResearchHub while remaining the chief executive at Knowledgr, while misleading MouseBelt in the process.</p><p>During this time, MouseBelt alleges, Joyce used an algorithm originally intended for Knowledgr for ResearchHub instead.</p><p>тАЬMouseBelt asked whether Joyce had recently been in touch with Armstrong or ResearchHub. Joyce stated that neither he nor anyone else at Knowledgr had been in touch with Armstrong during the previous four months. Joyce would later admit the truth, which was that Armstrong had asked Joyce to work on ResearchHub during that same four-month period and that Joyce actually had been doing so.

DeFi projects like Inverse Finance rely on smart contracts instead of centralized middlemen to offer financial services to crypto users, such as lending, borrowing and trading.</p><p>Inverse Finance allows users to get token loans by supplying tokens to the protocol as collateral. The newly launched floki pool has a collateral factor of 50% as of Wednesday, which means users can take 50% of the value of their staked floki inu tokens in the form of DOLA, a stablecoin issued by Inverse Finance pegged on a one-to-one basis with the U.S. dollar, or other tokens.</p><p>There is no expiration date on the loan. However, if floki inu tokens drop in value and a userтАЩs borrow limit exceeds 100%, the loan is liquidated and a 13% fee is taken on top of repayment to the liquidators.</p><p>тАЬThis process is automated and cannot be stopped so please borrow responsibly and do not borrow the full limit,тАЭ a document by Inverse Finance cautions.</p><p>The addition of floki inu comes after an onchain governance proposal was passed by the Inverse Finance community on Tuesday. Projects like Inverse Finance operate as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), relying on their community to propose newer ways of growth, adoption and other technical improvements.</p><p>However, the addition did little to budge floki inu prices. CoinGecko data show prices remain flat at $0.00012 after an initial spike on Tuesday night. Token prices are down 32% in the past 30 days, mirroring a fall in the broader crypto market.</p><p>Named after Elon MuskтАЩs pet dog Floki, floki inu is one of the many meme coins entrants that mushroomed in the crypto market this year. A тАЬrug pullтАЭ scare plagued the project early on after the original developer went rogue and exited with hundreds of thousands of dollars by draining a liquidity pool.</p><p>But community admins kept the token going and invested their own funds to keep the token afloat. A тАЬV2тА│ version was announced by early adopters who helped relaunch the project, this time with security mechanisms to prevent rug pulls in place. The project has since grown to a market capitalization of $1.2 billion тАУ attracting criticism from the likes of the U.K.тАЩs advertisement authorities for its incessant marketing on LondonтАЩs public transport.</p><p>Floki inu is also working on contributions outside of the crypto market. Tweets by developers on Monday claimed the project will build schools in Guatemala, Nigeria and Laos in partnership with local government authorities and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).</p>",

        "slug": "market-wrap-year-end-review-musk-pumps-bitcoin-and-dogecoin",
        "content": "<p>Hello, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021 weтАЩre using this space to recap the yearтАЩs most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets тАУ and highlight key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, weтАЩre recapping what shook crypto markets this year. (For the latest crypto prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)</p><p>On Monday, we recounted how even as bitcoin staged a powerful price rally to the start of the year, some institutional investors began to question the sustainability of the trend. Today, weтАЩll show how, during January and February, coordination and posts on social media fueled even more demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, delaying an immediate price correction.</p><p>As bitcoin (BTC) soared in February, social media, particularly Twitter, appeared to take on an expanded role in cryptocurrency markets, with prices pumping in response to tweet after tweet. It became clear that investor appetite for risk remained strong despite earlier concerns about rampant speculation.</p><p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk and then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted away to push bitcoin higher from $40,000 in January to nearly $57,000 in February. The viral effects of social media pushed retail traders into full-on buy mode, with bones thrown to the doggy-themed joke token dogecoin (DOGE) that added billions of dollars to that cryptocurrencyтАЩs market value.</p><p>On social media, some traders banded together in an effort to keep crypto prices elevated тАУ similar to the way retail traders in traditional markets had coordinated to roil stocks like GameStop.</p><p>For example, Musk, ranked by Forbes as the worldтАЩs richest person, added the #Bitcoin hashtag to his Twitter profile, contributing to an immediate 11% BTC price rally. Shortly afterward, Jack Dorsey also added the #Bitcoin hashtag to his twitter profile.</p><p>The bitcoin endorsements by Musk and Dorsey went viral, inspiring a league of traders who dismissed the cautionary warnings of more experienced investors. It all seemed like a lot of fun. And bitcoin was not the only cryptocurrency to advance.</p><p>Musk also suggested in a tweet that dogecoin might be тАЬthe future currency of earth.тАЭ MuskтАЩs involvement in the dog token tribe helped send DOGE mooooning (his word), along with other alternative cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Such hijinks kept the crypto party going. HereтАЩs a look at relative performance in January; DOGE vastly outperformed bitcoin in January, as shown below:</p><p>How could one man cause such a massive move in crypto markets? CoinDeskтАЩs Edward Oosterbaan explained earlier this month how MuskтАЩs star power was able to sway the price of BTC and DOGE. (Spoiler alert: None of this is all that deep.)</p><p>тАЬMusk is far from the only person to move the crypto market for no apparent reason other than making an endorsement,тАЭ Oosterbaan wrote. тАЬA sizable portion of the industry from meme coins to NFTs has proven to be highly responsive to celebrity shilling.тАЭ</p><p>Oosterbaan continued: тАЬHigh-profile celebrities and Twitter accounts sowing FOMO (fear of missing out) are likely here to stay. The power of social media in the crypto market is testament to the general lack of regulation and maturity, and the inherent liquidity of 24/7, permissionless assets.тАЭ</p><p>The chart below tracks MuskтАЩs influence on the DOGE price over time, using data from TradingView.</p><p>During bitcoinтАЩs swift ascent in January and February, retail traders used social media as a gateway to discover new alternative cryptocurrencies and react to market sentiment in real time.</p><p>In just a few tweets, Musk and other popular figures were able to pump and dump coins, leading to significant price gains and losses.</p><p>The lesson of this ever-so-bizarre stretch of crypto markets history is that social media was, and still is, a force thatтАЩs impossible for traders to ignore.</p><p>Here are the biggest gainers and losers among the CoinDesk 20 digital assets, over the past 24 hours:</p><p>Sector classifications are provided via the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), developed by CoinDesk Indices to provide a reliable, comprehensive and standardized classification system for digital assets. The CoinDesk 20 is a ranking of the largest digital assets by volume on trusted exchanges.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Indian government should avoid a ban on private cryptocurrencies, according to a report by Indian non-profit organization Centre for Internet and Society (CIS), which has been cited by lawmakers for reference in the past.</p><p>The report comes as the Indian government is looking to introduce a crypto bill that will reportedly ban most private cryptocurrencies. But first it needs to be approved by the ruling Cabinet and then the parliament. However, recent reports suggest that this process could be delayed by several weeks.</p><p>CIS has previously been part of a group that delved into the тАЬRight to PrivacyтАЭ in India. The Supreme Court of India also cited CIS research during the landmark judgment on тАЬRight to Privacy.тАЭ</p><p>As an interim solution, the report recommends reiterating that crypto is not legal tender and then taking тАЬsteps to classify crypto-assets under the existing financial framework.тАЭ</p><p>Another interim recommendation is to give existing financial regulators, such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) jurisdiction over crypto-assets. For example, classifying crypto-assets as derivatives to grant SEBI jurisdiction, so the regulator could make its existing know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules applicable to crypto exchanges.</p><p>SEBI could also decide to classify crypto as collective investment schemes, which would lead to crypto exchanges issuing SEBI-compliant crypto assets, the report says. Similarly, crypto can also be notified as derivates giving RBI jurisdiction, the report adds.</p><p>As a long-term measure, the report recommends that since crypto assets do not fit into any of the existing classifications of financial instruments they need to be regulated through тАЬa specific and standalone regulatory framework.тАЭ</p><p>The report strongly recommends a specific regulatory structure for stablecoins, one that is held to a higher regulatory standard than other crypto assets. Additionally, the recommendations lean on global consensus on stablecoin regulation that rules applicable to stablecoins should be similar to the rules applicable to banks.</p><p>Only crypto assets, not the underlying technology, should be regulated, CIS said in the report. This would allow for further innovation, the report adds.</p><p>This is in line with the narrative from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Last week, Modi said that тАЬWe must also jointly shape global norms for emerging technologies like social media and cryptocurrencies so that they are used to empower democracy, not to undermine it.тАЭ</p><p>The report also suggests a license and registration system for companies that are involved in crypto-related businesses, which would allow state governments to effectively monitor them. Limitations on crypto mining and appropriate taxation were also part of the reportтАЩs recommendations.</p><p>One of the key recommendations is the establishment of a separate body to oversee and research changes in the crypto market, which would then make recommendations to RBI or SEBI, whichever becomes the eventual regulator.</p><p>Read more: IndiaтАЩs Crypto Bill Likely to Be Delayed for Several Weeks: Reports</p>",

ThatтАЩs a sign more and more people are scanning the web for information on NFTs. In comparison, searches for тАЬbitcoinтАЭ and тАЬetherтАЭ have eased significantly in recent weeks, with scores hovering below 50. A similar pattern is seen for тАЬdogecoinтАЭ and тАЬshiba inu,тАЭ the joke cryptocurrencies seen by small investors as leverage plays on bitcoin.</p><p>Still, while interest in digital collectibles has remained resilient, perhaps due to several headline-grabbing projects announced in the past few weeks, usage metrics such as daily transaction volume and daily users show the top NFT platformsтАЩ activity has slowed considerably since August.</p><p>тАЬIn December and November, daily transaction volume on OpenSea, considered to be the most active NFT platform, averaged $67 million, compared to an all-time high of $303 million in August,тАЭ FRNT Financial said in its newsletter published Monday.</p><p>тАЬGoogle searches for тАШNon-Fungible TokenтАЩ are highest in China, followed by Singapore, Venezuela, Hong Kong and the Philippines,тАЭ FRNT Financial said. тАЬOver the past 12 months, the two most popular related search topics are тАШapes,тАЩ due to the Bored Ape Yacht Club Collection, and MetaMask.тАЭ</p><p>Google Trends provides access to a mostly unfiltered sample of search requests and scales them along a range of 0 to 100, according to the company. The search value represents the search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the selected region and time.</p><p>The price of bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped by 30% in the past five weeks, dragging the broader market lower and instilling a sense of unease in market participants. The cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index recently fell below 25, signaling extreme fear.</p><p>Interest in digital collectibles may have been buoyed by new projects announced in the past few weeks, FRNT Financial noted.</p><p>Last week, former First Lady Melania Trump announced the launch of an NFT series and a non-fungible token platform on programmable blockchain Solana. On Friday, sportswear giant Adidas Originals said it earned $23.5 million from NFT sales. And on Monday, basketball giant Michael Jordan and his son announced the launch of an athlete-focused NFT program in 2022.</p><p>Assuming the broader market mood remains dour, widespread interest in NFTs represented by web search data could decline once the sugar rush from the recent project announcements fades. After all, a perfect score of 100 has marked major price tops in bitcoin, SolanaтАЩs SOL token and other cryptocurrencies.</p>",

Active, current and new users can earn BMEX tokens as of Tuesday.</p><p>BMEX tokens are similar to other exchange tokens such as BinanceтАЩs Binance coin and FTXтАЩs FTT. Users can earn BMEX based on trading volumes at BitMEX and the fees generated for the exchange. More use cases for the token are expected in the future, as per the post.</p><p>BMEX will have a maximum supply of 450 million tokens vested over a period of up to five years, the exchange noted in a separate post. тАЬThe large majority of BMEX will be spent to reward users and grow the BitMEX ecosystem. An allocation of 20% is reserved for BitMEX employees and another 25% for our long-term commitment to the token and ecosystem,тАЭ the post added.</p><p>BitMEX, derived from тАЬBitcoin Mercantile Exchange,тАЭ was founded in 2014 and introduced bitcoin futures to the crypto market. This contributed to a change in market structure as traders could use leverage to place larger bets on the price movements of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin.</p><p>The exchange was also the first to introduce Perpetual Futures, a futures product without time-based expiry date as opposed to traditional market futures, which have an expiry date. Perpetual futures are a market standard these days, with nearly all crypto exchanges offering them instead of time-based futures.</p><p>Futures are a financial instrument that allows traders to bet on asset prices without holding the actual asset. Leverage is usually offered on futures, allowing the use of borrowed funds to increase oneтАЩs trading position on a relatively smaller initial capital.</p><p>тАЬBitMEX тАШdegensтАЩ and the тАШtrollboxтАЩ were mainstays of the Wild West world of crypto trading before newer exchanges launched and gained relevance after 2017,тАЬ said Tim Behrsin, founder of crypto project Grexie.</p><p>тАЬBitMEX issuing tokens is how the exchange remains relevant among new crypto traders spoilt by choice by rival exchanges that offer interest-accruing exchange tokens and discounts based on tokens held. This is evident by the popularity of Binance coin, which has a market capitalization of $89 billion and is the worldтАЩs third-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin and ethereum,тАЭ Behrsin said.</p><p>BitMEX processed billions of dollars worth of futures volumes in 2018 as the product gained relevance among users. It has since lost volumes to competitors like Binance, Huobi, and FTX, which offer their native tokens to users helping them save on trading fees and offer a wider range of assets to trade.</p><p>Analytics tool Glassnode shows bitcoin futures volumes on BitMEX in the past 24 hours was a tad above $1 billion. The 2017-founded Binance, in contrast, recorded over $23 billion in trading volume for a similar product.</p><p>However, exchange tokens do not necessarily equate to higher volumes or user base. U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, two of the worldтАЩs biggest crypto exchanges by volume, do not offer native tokens to users.</p><p>BitMEX has also been in the news in the last few years for its regulatory violations. In 2020, the exchange along with its co-founders were charged by U.S. regulators for facilitating unregistered trading and other violations. In August 2021, BitMEX said it reached a settlement with regards to the the civil charges against the exchange, and will pay a $100 million penalty to the regulators.</p><p>UPDATE (Dec. 21, 12:22 UTC): Adds details on BitMEXтАЩs regulatory violations in last paragraph.</p>",

As such, T-Systems will be running several validators, both private and public, for the Polkadot network, Dittrich explained.</p><p>тАЬLike we did before with Celo, we are also investing in DOT tokens to be able to participate in the governance of the network, and basically put our money where our mouth is to support our infrastructure case,тАЭ Dittrich said in an interview with CoinDesk. тАЬThe main difference now is that this is not a VC [venture capital] or innovation budget anymore; we are doing this from our business unit. So this really has become a business case for us. I have to say, IтАЩm really proud we are doing this.тАЭ</p><p>T-Systems may have had to wait a year or two until Polkadot was up and running, but the timing of this audacious move is sharp: The networkтАЩs first тАЬparachainsтАЭ went live over the weekend.</p><p>Read more: Polkadot Parachains Go Live, Capping Yearslong Tech Build for Ambitious Blockchain Project</p><p>Currently, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, stablecoins and Ethereum-compatibility protocols are the focus of the тАЬlayer 1тА│ networks anchored to the тАЬlayer 0тА│ that is Polkadot. Layer 1 refers to blockchains that run independently of other blockchains тАУ as contrasted with тАЬlayer 2тА│ systems that aim to speed up transactions on existing blockchains like Ethereum.</p><p>In terms of use cases that T-Systems might identify, Dittrich pointed to the early days of enterprise blockchain, when Deutsche Telekom joined the Linux-affiliated Hyperledger stable of permissioned ledgers.</p><p>тАЬI think the opportunities that Polkadot provides for enterprise use cases are really interesting,тАЭ Dittrich said. тАЬIt gives you the flexibility and security of a public, permissionless blockchain, but it has both a separation of concerns by parachains, and interoperability among use cases. So even the good old supply-chain use case could make a lot of sense on Polkadot, and I know that big industry consortia are definitely eyeing that ecosystem.тАЭ</p>",

They allow developers and the community to test applications and features in a controlled setting.</p><p>Kintsugi, named for the Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold, is one of the final public testnets before Ethereum 2.0. ThatтАЩs a plan to convert the blockchain to a proof-of-stake mechanism тАУ one that relies on validators locking up tokens to validate transactions and maintain the network тАУ instead of its current proof-of-work consensus design. Earlier testnets were available only to developers.</p><p>тАЬAlthough client development and UX [user experience] continue to be refined, we encourage the community to start using Kintsugi to familiarize themselves with Ethereum in a post-merge context,тАЭ Beiko said. тАЬFor application developers, as previously explained, not much will change. Tooling which only interacts with either the consensus or execution layer is also largely unaffected.тАЭ</p><p>Dubbed a тАЬlonger-lived public testnet,тАЭ Kintsugi is where anyone can experiment with Ethereum in the exact manner the network would operate after the changeover. This could mean testing niche decentralized finance (DeFi) tools, which rely on smart contracts to provide financial services, to more technical usage of the network.</p><p>The move follows a nearly year-long process to shift to Eth 2.0. Four so-called devnets launched in the past year after the Phase 0 launch of the Beacon Chain. The Beacon Chain already stores billions of dollars worth of value, data from on-chain analytics tool Dune Analytics show. It exists separately from the current Ethereum network but will eventually be merged.</p><p>Kintsugi is expected to run until it reaches stability along with other testnets, following which a move to Eth 2.0 takes place. тАЬExisting long-lived testnets will run through The Merge.

        "content": "<p>After less than a month of deliberation and voting, two decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) have consummated one of the biggest mergers in decentralized finance (DeFi) history.</p><p>On Tuesday, at Ethereum block height 13850929, a vote to merge Rari Capital and Fei Protocol was approved by members of both DAOs. The measure passed by a 93% to 1% margin among RariтАЩs RGT holders and 90% to 0% rate among those with FeiтАЩs TRIBE. Going forward, the projects will merge via a token swap and be united under the TRIBE token.</p><p>A total of 103 wallet addresses participated in the election. The joint effort will immediately command $2 billion in total value locked (TVL).</p><p>While the merger between xDAI and Gnosis earlier this month also featured a token swap, this is the largest DAO merger featuring a governance token integration to date.</p><p>In an interview with CoinDesk, Fei founder Joey Santoro said the historic deal was at times unwieldy тАУ especially when both token holder communities initially seemed skeptical of one another тАУ but he and Rari co-founder Jai Bhavnani were aligned in their desire to move quickly on a deal.</p><p>Read more: Rari Capital, Fei Protocol Look to Overcome Bagholder Bias in Ambitious DeFi Merger</p><p>тАЬIt was really challenging to navigate a proposal this big. There were two whole DAOs worth of cooks in the kitchen. But Jai and the core teams and I were devoted to putting this out there,тАЭ said Santoro.</p><p>Per the terms of the merger, RariтАЩs RGT token holders will be able to exchange their tokens at a rate of 26.7 TRIBE to RGT at any point within a 180-day window. Additionally, TRIBE holders dissatisfied with the deal will have a three-day window to exchange TRIBE for a proportional share of Fei ProtocolтАЩs treasury.</p><p>In addition to requiring social consensus from the two investor communities, the merger is technically a complex one, requiring multiple custom contracts and multiple on-chain votes.</p><p>Initially crypto research firm GFX Labs attempted to lend some engineering heft, but ultimately backed out as the community balked at GFXтАЩs requested $3.5 million price tag vested over two years.</p><p>As a result the teams built the contracts related to exchanging RARI for TRIBE, as well as a тАЬragequitтАЭ function тАУ a contract that allows token holders to exchange their tokens for a proportional share of the protocolтАЩs treasury, a feature first iterated in Ethereum ecosystem grants organization MolochDAO.</p><p>According to Santoro, the ragequit function was instituted in part to appease TRIBE holders dissatisfied with the terms of the deal.</p><p>тАЬThe ragequit allows TRIBE token holders, especially token holders that market-bought TRIBE below treasury value, to exit at intrinsic value. Adding that in made everyone aligned,тАЭ he said.</p><p>The ragequit will be live for three days, and may be reinstituted if TRIBE ever trades below treasury value. Santoro declined to speculate on how widely itтАЩll be used, but said that instituting the function was a byproduct of two ambitious teams that wanted to move quickly on a merger rather than hash out technicalities.</p><p>тАЬAfter a certain point, you canтАЩt keep debating. You have to say, тАШWeтАЩre over the line here. WeтАЩre going to keep executing,тАЩтАЭ he said.</p><p>Now that the votes have passed, the real experiment arguably begins: Can two separate teams with disparate leadership structures operate efficiently under the same governance token?</p><p>DAO management has come under scrutiny in recent weeks, following the high-profile failure of ConstitutionDAO to acquire a rare copy of the constitution, and infighting within Sushi leading to the departure of CTO Joseph Delong.</p><p>Read more: Sushi CTO Joseph Delong Resigns After Reports of Project Infighting</p><p>However, there are instances of multilayered or fractionalized DAOs working well. MakerDAO, which deploys a series of cloistered тАЬcore units,тАЭ recently announced a $20 million bond experiment with French multinational banking giant Soci├йt├й G├йn├йrale.</p><p>Santoro believes TRIBEтАЩs multi-tiered structure will lend itself to managing the two teams. Additionally, he noted that if there are conflicts and potential power struggles, the DAO can institute new governance structures with a vote, but that after multiple meetings the two teams are currently aligned.</p><p>тАЬWe see the world in similar ways,тАЭ Santoro said. тАЬWeтАЩve also had hard internal discussions тАУ this wasnтАЩt all kumbaya idealism, but we got it sorted like adults and IтАЩm extremely bullish on our ability to coordinate and cooperate as equals, and if it doesnтАЩt work weтАЩll vote in a structure that does.тАЭ</p><p>The first product from the joint project is expected to launch in тАЬlate January, early February,тАЭ said Santoro.</p><p>Additionally, the team is looking to expand further via DAO acquisitions.</p><p>тАЬTRIBE is moving towards becoming full-stack DeFi infrastructure,тАЭ said Santoro. тАЬWeтАЩre trying to fill all the product gaps and become an in-house mega-DAO.тАЭ</p><p>He mentioned automated market makers (AMM), structured products and derivatives as acquisition and/or expansion targets.</p><p>The expenditures are notable given that other teams are preparing their treasuries for a possible looming bear market, but Santoro sees further expansion as strategically advantageous:</p><p>тАЬI think long term itтАЩll be more beneficial for us to join forces with sick teams than it would be to preserve assets. And itтАЩs not like we have this huge burn-through. WeтАЩre lean teams. WeтАЩre ready to ride out a bear.тАЭ</p>",

(by Joon Ian Wong, the founding co-president of the Association of Cryptocurrency Journalists and Researchers.)</p><p>тАЬWen token?тАЭ</p><p>ItтАЩs the refrain heard in Discord servers around the world. When is such-and-such project going to airdrop a token to its community members? This question is particularly urgent if a community happens to assemble around a $2 billion NFT project тАУ one like Bored Ape Yacht Club. ThatтАЩs why BAYC had an answer to the question in October:</p><p>As the Bored Ape holders have discovered, itтАЩs super cool to launch a non-fungible token collection and see a community develop around it. But at some point it gets difficult to herd all the cats тАУ especially if said cats are also very rich people. What if there were some way to coordinate them and align their interests? What if you could do all of this on-chain? With a cryptographic token perhaps?</p><p>This article is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment.</p><p>This is why the future of non-fungible tokens is fungible. The many NFT communities that have sprung up this year are finding that itтАЩs not so easy to manage a community with unique tokens alone. Fungible tokens created by the community start to become very attractive in theory. Luckily for them, this concept already exists: itтАЩs the world of social tokens тАУ streams of community-centric tokens that are, yes, fungible.</p><p>The non-fungible argument</p><p>Social tokens have been ably covered in the pages of this fine website for some time. HereтАЩs a great Jeff Wilser feature that dives deep into the genre. But hereтАЩs a quick summary of how theyтАЩre supposed to work: Suppose you spot a promising young artist from among the selection presented to you by SpotifyтАЩs algorithm. You stream their music thousands of times over the years, gradually attending concerts and buying merch. Eventually, the artist breaks through to the mainstream and is picking up Grammys left and right, and appearing on тАЬSaturday Night Live.тАЭ</p><p>The above example might be called the тАЬTaylor Swift HypothesisтАЭ of social tokens. The way the hypothesis works is, imagine injecting a token into the scenario above. What if that artist is Taylor Swift, and what if she has issued $SWIFT in the earliest days of your fandom. You might have accumulated lots of $SWIFT, watching the stash grow in fiat money terms as Taylor ascended the heights of pop stardom. The Swift Hypothesis is described in the Index Ventures investor Rex WoodburyтАЩs recent think piece on social tokens in The Atlantic.</p><p>But letтАЩs look at why some NFT believers think fungible tokens for communities donтАЩt work. HereтАЩs GMoney, the cutesy, pixelated, half-man, half-monkey NFT collector making his argument: A stash of tokens is first held by a creator who distributes the tokens to fans. As the creator creates more valuable work, those tokens rise in price. But to realize those gains, the creator must continuously sell the tokens to fans. This leaves creators with a diminishing horde of tokens, thus disincentivizing them to increase the value of their work.</p><p>тАЬYour incentives are misaligned,тАЭ GMoney says.</p><p>ThatтАЩs the catch: Taylor would have been dumping $SWIFT on her fans all the way to the top. Her most loyal fans would have been her exit liquidity, to adopt the parlance of Crypto Twitter. The Swift Hypothesis would become the Swift Pump and Dump if that was the only way social tokens worked.</p><p>And GMoney isnтАЩt alone among the cryptorati casting doubt on social tokens. HereтАЩs Simon de la Rouviere, one of the authors of the ERC-721 standard, positing that NFTs are, in fact, better social tokens!</p><p>The social tokens rebuttal</p><p>This is as good a place as any to mention that I have a vested interest in social tokens working. IтАЩm an adviser at Rally, which helps esports streamers, musicians and creators of all stripes issue their own tokens to fans. IтАЩm also a contributor and investor in Seed Club, an accelerator for social token projects.</p><p>As we know in crypto, misaligned incentives is one of the most damning charges that can be leveled at a project. So I turned to Jess Sloss, the person who started Seed Club and who stays at the cutting edge of social tokens, for a robust rebuttal to GMoneyтАЩs monkey business.</p><p>тАЬSocial tokens are better equity,тАЭ Sloss tells me. Dear reader, before you start dialing the Securities and Exchange Commission hotline for unregistered securities offerings, this is what he really meant by that: Fungible tokens for a community are more expressive than NFTs. While NFTs might be good at capital raising and formation, they are less good at keeping a community going. This is where social tokens come in.</p><p>тАЬWhat many of these communities havenтАЩt thought through is how to sustain [them] into the future?тАЭ Sloss says. тАЬUltimately, we need to be able to reward more nuanced collaboration and represent that in the governance stack.тАЭ</p><p>For instance, a community might need to pay core members for development or editorial work. It might need to raise new funding without diluting existing creative work. It might also need a way to vote on stuff.</p><p>HereтАЩs how Sloss frames it, using the startup as a metaphor: тАЬIf a creator has a community of fans looking to create something bigger and more broad than the work of that creator, then a fungible token makes a lot of sense.</p><p>See also: Missed the ENS Airdrop? | Opinion</p><p>тАЬEssentially, you have a bank account and a cap table. The fungible token represents that cap table that you can use to pay people, sell for investment [and] reward people for the work they do in that community. All those things are very hard to do with an NFT unless youтАЩre minting new NFTs and giving them away, or youтАЩre holding bags of NFTs ... YouтАЩre going to get stuck at some point.тАЭ</p><p>Bored Apes could be a glimpse into the future of an NFT community that gets coordinated around a new, fungible, token. SquiggleDAO, which Sloss works on, is another example: a collector DAO for generative art and Chromie Squiggles in particular, its $SQUIG token lets holders vote on how they use the DAOтАЩs resources, which includes $8 million in USDC it raised from selling $SQUIG to big investors.</p><p>The fun in fungible</p><p>What else can you do with a social token? Sloss corrects me: The term of art now is community tokens or community DAOs. He says heтАЩs seeing a surge of interest in founders of Web 2 companies exploring how to disperse ownership of their firms to communities using a DAO as he sifts through applications for Seed ClubтАЩs fourth cohort (the third cohort had Pussy Riot and other notables). тАЬTheyтАЩre recognizing theyтАЩre building on a tech stack that will be quickly outdated and will have a tough time competing with a Web 3 version of their product,тАЭ he said. тАЬThereтАЩs an explosion of DAOs being created right now.тАЭ</p><p>The hottest use cases, Sloss says, are DAOs that aid learning, particularly learning about Web 3. He name DAO Masters, Web3 baddies (тАЬwelcome to the hot girl metaverseтАЭ) and the Crypto, Culture and Society DAO as prime examples. HeтАЩs also bullish on a token from the industry newsletter Water and Music that incentivizes research on music and technology among its subscribers.</p><p>тАЬI think longevity is going to come into the operations,тАЭ Sloss says. тАЬItтАЩs like, letтАЩs go out and buy the Constitution тАж then what?

        "content": "<p>Hello, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021, weтАЩre using this space to recap this yearтАЩs most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets тАУ and highlight the key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, weтАЩll recap what shook crypto markets this year. (For the latest crypto prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)</p><p>In our first episode today, we show how, even as bitcoinтАЩs price soared in the early days of the year, some savvy institutional investors were already growing cautious on cryptocurrencies after a wave of buying during the fourth quarter of 2020.</p><p>Bitcoin (BTC) started 2021 on a strong note, gaining nearly 40% during the first week of January and surging to a new all-time high around $40,000.</p><p>But not everyone was convinced the rally could be sustained.</p><p>Retail traders piled in, while some institutional investors started to raise concerns about rampant speculation.</p><p>As early as December, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto asset management firm Arca, had told CoinDesk that тАЬthere is a good chance that actively managed hedge funds and passive indexes built around high allocations to bitcoin have a very short shelf life.тАЭ</p><p>Indeed, a few funds established bitcoin positions but did not тАЭhold on for dear lifeтАЭ тАУ a commonly misconstrued back-formation of the crypto-jargon term тАЬHODL,тАЭ which originally appeared as a fast-typing (or maybe drunk?) personтАЩs attempt to type the world тАЬhold.тАЭ</p><p>Bitcoin quickly advanced from $30,000 to $40,000 within the first five trading days of January тАУ an impressive gain that fueled even more market excitement. The sharp price rise in BTC contributed to a $1.1 billion profit for Ruffer Investments, a U.K. based investment management firm, in just five months. By June, Ruffer stated that a тАЬspeculative frenzyтАЭ in cryptocurrencies forced the firm to exit its bets on further gains.</p><p>And Ruffer was not alone in its concern about market exuberance. Volatile price swings caused other institutional investors to doubt a prolonged crypto rally.</p><p>Sure enough, by the end of January, bitcoin had declined about 30% from a January high of near $40,000. Shortly after the price drop, Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at the Guggenheim global investment firm, said he didnтАЩt believe bitcoinтАЩs investor base was тАЬbig enoughтАЭ or тАЬdeep enoughтАЭ to keep prices at current levels.</p><p>тАЬRight now, the reality of the institutional demand that would support a $35,000 price or even a $30,000 price is just not there,тАЭ he said.</p><p>At the same time, a JPMorgan analyst said a bearish outlook could be triggered if bitcoin failed to claw its way back over $40,000, leading to steeper losses over the ensuing weeks.</p><p>Demand from institutional investors was said to have been the cause for the astronomical rise of the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization in the fourth quarter of 2020, when Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller and MicroStrategy said they had jumped into the market.</p><p>As coming installments of this series will show, the rest of 2021 would be defined by market-moving tweets from electric-vehicle billionaire Elon Musk, rapid price rallies in barely-heard-of alternative cryptocurrencies, a fresh wave of corporate buy-in to the legitimacy and potential of digital assets, plenty more moments of extreme volatility тАУ and, eventually, a new all-time high of around $69,000.</p><p>(As of 21:00 coordinated universal time, or 4 p.m. ET)</p><p>Here are the biggest gainers and losers among the CoinDesk 20 digital assets, over the past 24 hours:</p><p>Sector classifications are provided via the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), developed by CoinDesk Indices to provide a reliable, comprehensive and standardized classification system for digital assets.

        "content": "<p>Terraform Labs and its CEO, Do Kwon, are challenging the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), claiming the regulator improperly served Kwon subpoenas at Mainnet 2021 despite not having jurisdiction over Kwon or his company. They have asked a New York court to dismiss the subpoenas.</p><p>Terraform filed a motion last Friday opposing an SEC effort to compel Kwon and Terraform Labs to cooperate with subpoenas issued in the SECтАЩs ongoing investigation of TerraтАЩs Mirror Protocol. The SEC filed its motion last month after Terraform and Kwon sued the agency on claims that it violated its own rules and the Due Process clause of the U.S. Constitution in serving Kwon in September.</p><p>Because the SECтАЩs lawyers did not get permission from the Commissioners to subpoena Kwon тАУ which must be done in cases where the subpoenaed party is represented by lawyers тАУ KwonтАЩs attorneys say he was improperly served, rendering the subpoenas invalid.</p><p>The Mirror Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to create and trade тАЬmirrored assets,тАЭ or mAssets, that тАЬmirrorтАЭ the price of stocks тАУ including major stocks traded on U.S. exchanges. It was launched last December.</p><p>On May 7, less than five months after the launch of the Mirror Protocol, the SEC opened an investigation to determine whether Terraform Labs was in violation of federal securities laws by allowing synthetic stocks to be minted and sold on its platform.</p><p>The SECтАЩs investigation of the Mirror Protocol is just one in a sea of similar investigations the U.S. regulator is conducting against crypto companies in an attempt to sniff out scams and regulate the booming crypto industry. The lack of regulatory clarity has been an issue for both crypto companies, which struggle to know what the rules are and what they can do legally, and regulators, such as the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that are in the midst of a power struggle for control over the regulation of the industry.</p><p>Under the leadership of Gary Gensler, the SEC has expanded its crypto regulation efforts. But with thousands of projects, the regulatory body has focused its efforts on major players like Coinbase. The Mirror ProtocolтАЩs fast growth тАУ documents filed by the SEC state the mAssets have a total value of $437 million and the protocolтАЩs governance token has a market capitalization of $407 million тАУ puts Terraform Labs squarely in the SECтАЩs crosshairs as a major crypto project.</p><p>But because Terraform Labs тАУ which was incorporated in Singapore and has offices in both Singapore and South Korea тАУ is not an American company and Do Kwon тАУ a South Korean national who lives in Singapore тАУ is not an American citizen, the SECтАЩs jurisdiction in its investigation was limited, according to TerraformтАЩs filings.</p><p>In late May, two weeks after opening their investigation, lawyers for the SEC contacted Kwon via email to inform him of the investigation of Mirror Protocol and asked him for his voluntary cooperation. Kwon agreed and hired U.S-based lawyers with Denton LLC, a large global law firm, to represent him.</p><p>According to KwonтАЩs attorneys, between May and September Kwon and Terraform voluntarily cooperated with the SEC, including participating in a five-hour video interview on July 8 where Kwon was asked to provide details about the Mirror ProtocolтАЩs creation and structure, as well as his personal ownership of any mAssets or MIR tokens, the protocolтАЩs governance token. Through his attorneys, Kwon also produced documents requested by the SEC.</p><p>On Sept. 15, KwonтАЩs lawyers say they were told by the SEC that, despite the SEC finding no conclusive evidence of any violations of U.S. securities laws, the investigation could only be resolved through an enforcement action.</p><p>On Sept. 17, lawyers for the SEC issued and signed two subpoenas тАУ one for Kwon and one for Terraform Labs тАУ which were then served to Kwon on September 20, as he was about to participate in a panel discussion at MessariтАЩs Mainnet 2021 conference in New York.</p><p>Despite rampant speculation on crypto Twitter, Kwon told the Defiant that he had not been served by the SEC at Mainnet. He later told CoinDesk that the lie was unintentional, claiming that he didnтАЩt know what had happened until later that day.</p><p>тАЬSomebody handed me, like, a packet of paper right before I had to go on stage,тАЭ Kwon told CoinDesk. тАЬAfter speaking at the conference тАж the stuff out on Twitter and people talking about people getting served тАУ thatтАЩs when we realized the SEC gave us a packet of paper that was supposed to mean something.тАЭ</p><p>On Oct. 22, Kwon and Terraform Labs filed a civil lawsuit in New York against the SEC тАУ a highly unusual move, as suits against the SEC are rare тАУ alleging the SEC improperly served the two Sept. 20 subpoenas. It also claims that the SEC does not have proper jurisdiction over either Kwon or Terraform Labs, and asked the court to quash the subpoenas and end the investigation.</p><p>Read More: TerraтАЩs Do Kwon Was Served by SEC, New Lawsuit Shows</p><p>In response, the SEC filed a separate application in the same court (the Southern District of New York) on Nov. 12, asking the court to compel Kwon and Terraform Labs to comply with the subpoenas, which demand the production of documents and KwonтАЩs appearance to testify in-person at the SECтАЩs headquarters in Washington, D.C.</p><p>In its application, the SEC denied that it improperly served the subpoenas. It also claims that it has rightful jurisdiction to serve the subpoenas тАУ jurisdiction over Kwon because he entered the United States and was served in person at Mainnet, and jurisdiction over Terraform Labs because it allows U.S-based customers to trade on its platform.</p><p>On Dec. 17, over a month after the SECтАЩs application was filed, Kwon and Terraform LabsтАЩ lawyers responded, denying the SECтАЩs claims that the subpoenas were properly served and asking the court to dismiss them outright.</p><p>The SEC has until Friday, Dec. 24, to respond to KwonтАЩs motion of opposition. Separately, the SEC must respond to Kwon and Terraform LabsтАЩ civil suit by Dec. 27</p>",

        "content": "<p>Bitcoin and ether were again trading lower in Asian hours, continuing the year-long trend of losing ground mainly when America is asleep. The decline comes as traditional markets turn a blind eye to ChinaтАЩs interest rate cut and remain risk averse.</p><p>At press time, bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, was trading near $46,600, representing a 0.5% drop on the day. Ether was changing hands near $3,850, down nearly 2% on the day.</p><p>Data provided by options trader Fredrick Collins shows that bitcoin and ether have consistently faced selling pressure during the Asian hours this year. Most of year-to-date gains made by bitcoin and ether, 60% and 420% respectively, have come during the American hours, represented by 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. New York time.</p><p>Both cryptocurrencies have taken a big hit in recent weeks, dragging the broader crypto market lower as the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks began unwinding the liquidity-boosting stimulus to contain inflation.</p><p>Bitcoin has declined more than 30% since peaking near $69,000 on Nov. 10, with sellers dominating the market during the Asian hours тАУ 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Beijing time.</p><p>The trend continued on Monday despite the PeopleтАЩs Bank of China (PBOC) taking steps to cushion the economy from the negative impact of property market woes and renewed coronavirus concerns.</p><p>The Chinese central bank announced a cut in its one-year loan prime rate, a de facto benchmark rate since 2019, from 3.85% to 3.8%, confirming the first reduction in nearly two years.</p><p>Interest rate cuts tend to inject liquidity into the economy. Thus, perceived inflation hedges like bitcoin, gold, and asset prices, in general, typically react positively to rate cuts.</p><p>However, Asian equities are currently flashing red alongside a 1.10% drop in the futures tied to the S&P 500. Oil prices are down more than 3% and the anti-risk currencies like the Japanese yen are drawing safe-haven bids.</p><p>The market action suggests ChinaтАЩs rate cut is perhaps too small compared to the impending tightening by the Fed and other central banks. Last week, the Fed signaled three rate hikes in 2022 and the Bank of England delivered a surprise interest rate hike.</p><p>Heightened fears of coronavirus lockdowns also appear to be overshadowing BeijingтАЩs move to improve market sentiment. European nations are reimposing stricter measures to stem the Omicron wave and ChinaтАЩs COVID zero policy is threatening to disrupt the global supply chain.</p><p>Lockdowns and supply chain disruptions are inflationary, which are seen as a positive development for a perceived store of value assets. Lockdowns also weigh over economic growth.</p><p>However, with elevated global price pressures, central banks appear to have little room for higher liquidity injection to prioritize growth as they did after the first COVID wave in the first half of 2020. Back then, inflation in the U.S. stood well below the FedтАЩs 2% target. As of November, U.S inflation stood at a four-decade high of 6.8%.</p><p>Fed ChairmJerome Powell recently retired the word тАЬtransitoryтАЭ from inflation discussions, signaling a shift in focus from employment (growth) to inflation control. The International Monetary Fund also urged the Fed to speed up policy tightening to contain inflation.</p>",
